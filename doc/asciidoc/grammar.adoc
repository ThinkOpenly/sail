This appendix contains a grammar for the Sail language that is
automatically generated from the
https://gallium.inria.fr/~fpottier/menhir[Menhir] parser definition.

NOTE: This means that the grammar is stated in such a way that the
parser generator can see it is free of LR shift/reduce and
reduce/reduce conflicts, rather than being optimised for human
readability.

First, we need some lexical conventions:

* `ID` is any valid Sail identifier

* `OPERATOR` is any valid Sail operator, as defined in <<Operators>>.

* `TYPE_VARIABLE` is a valid Sail identifier with a leading single quote `'`.

* `NUMBER` is a non-empty sequence of decimal digits `[0-9]+`.

* `HEXADECIMAL_LITERAL` is `0x[A-Ba-f0-9_]+`

* `BINARY_LITERAL` is `0b[0-1_]+`

* `STRING_LITERAL` is a Sail string literal.

`$[ATTRIBUTE]` and `$LINE_DIRECTIVE` represent attributes and single
line directives. Examples of line directives would be things like
`$include`, `$ifdef` and so on. These start with a leading `$`, are
followed by the directive name (which follows the same lexical rules
as a Sail identifier), is followed by one or more spaces, then
proceeds to the end of the line, with everything between the
identifier and the line ending being the line directive's argument
(with leading and trailing whitespace removed). An attribute starts
with `$[` and ends with `]`, and in between consists of an attribute
name, followed by at least one whitespace character, then any
arbitrary sequence of characters that does not contain `]`.
